# django-celery-stack

Django Celery Stack & Admin is a full-featured stack that integrates Django, Celery, and DjangoAsyncAdmin, designed to provide web developers with a powerful and user-friendly asynchronous task and scheduling solution. The integration of Django’s powerful web framework, Celery’s task queue and scheduling capabilities, and DjangoAsyncAdmin’s asynchronous management interface allows developers to easily implement complex data processing, scheduled tasks, and interactive management in their Django projects.

### Django Celery Stack & Admin offers the following key features:
* **Asynchronous Task Queue** :
  
      Utilize Celery’s distributed message passing system to delegate CPU-bound tasks to the background, improving the responsiveness and performance of the application.
  
* Scheduled Task Scheduler:

      With the built-in Celery Beat scheduler, easily arrange periodic tasks such as data synchronization, report generation, etc.
  
* Task Result Tracking:

      Leverage Celery’s result backend to persist task execution results, making it easier to debug and monitor task status.
  
* Progress Updates:

      By integrating with django-celery-progress, provide real-time task progress updates to users for interactive feedback.
  
* Optimized Management Interface:

      Building on the foundation of the three projects, DjangoAsyncAdmin is used to optimize and enhance the interaction and management pages, making it more intuitive and convenient to manage tasks and monitor progress.
  
* Easy to Integrate and Extend:

      The design of Django Celery Stack & Admin is flexible, allowing for easy integration with other Django applications and Celery components to meet various requirements.
